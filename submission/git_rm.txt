1. no the file does not remain on my machine, but if I used the --cached command it would keep it

2. use git rm when you want to remove it from the repository also I would think its good practice to keep file deletions on a record rather than deleting off the system

3. One website says to use $ git reset --hard HEAD~1 if the file was deleted and then there was a commit. the HEAD~1 being the last commit that was done.
